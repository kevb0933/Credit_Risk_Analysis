# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we were asked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Different techniques were used to train and evaluate along with the following libraries:

1.imbalanced-learn

2.scikit-learn

3.RandomOverSampler

4.SMOTE algorithms

5.ClusterCentroids algorithm

6.LogisticRegression

7.SMOTEENN algorithm

8.BalancedRandomForestClassifier

9.EasyEnsembleClassifier

Balanced Accuracy: 0.646602844334948, Precision: The precision shows low for High-risk loans but high for Low-risk loans, Recall: High/Low risk = .74/.55
